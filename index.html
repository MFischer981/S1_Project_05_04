            <h1>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h1>
            <p>Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best
                long-distance runners
                in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record
                set
                last year by
                Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third, respectively. Laura's victory
                came on the
                heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running
                for
                Colorado
                State.</p>
            <p>In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's marathon
                for
                the second
                straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of Billings,
                Montana, finished
                second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in
                a
                very
                competitive field.</p>
            <p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with over
                9500 men and
                6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never
                exceeded
                85 degrees.</p>

            <h1>Highway 7 Reopens</h1>
            <p>Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection. A late blizzard delayed
                road crews,
                marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the highway's reopening.</p>
            <p>Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and Grand Lake.
                The
                reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist season will soon
                be upon us!</p>

            <h1>Cougar Sightings Increase </h1>
            <p>Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released yesterday by
                the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding
                communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve sightings for the entire
                spring of last year.
            </p>
            <p>Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people into former
                wildlife
                habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being taken by
                hunters. Cougars
                may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds.</p>
            <p>DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they believe they
                have seen a
                cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in the west this year from
                cougar attacks.</p>

            <h1>If You Encounter a Cougar</h1>
            <p>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.</p>
            <p>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</p>
            <p>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</p>
            <p>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar that you are
                not prey, but a potential danger.</p>
            <p>In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively. </p>
